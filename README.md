👤 # Hi, I'm Massimo Belfiore :)

I'm BSc Computer Science student from Catania with a strong interest in Big Data Analytics, Embedded Systems, Cloud Computing, and AI.
I'm curious and I enjoy studying and learning new things.

## 💻 Main Projects

- **MySQL Recipes Platform** — full relational database design plus a web page in php that shows the recipe of the day.
- **C++ Data Structures Collection** — custom implementations of lists, queues, and trees.
- **Autogen 0.2 Seminar** — technical presentation on LLM agent framework.  
- **Arduino Spectrum Analyzer** — audio signal processing using microcontrollers.

**You can find some of them in my pinned repositories, and the others at the following links**:

#include <iostream<iostream>>

int main(int argc, char** argv){

char message[] = "I know that goto instruction is dangerous, deprecated and means "Spaghetti Code" but let me use it as it fits good with this";
    
goto cplusplusProject;

std::cout << "Click on the links to see the projects\n";

cplusplusProject:       https://github.com/programmazione2-DMI/a-l-progetto-3-gruppo-2-MassimoBelfioreCode ;

std::cout << message;

goto arduinoAudioProject;

std::cout << "\n";

arduinoAudioProject:   https://fmilotta.github.io/teaching/computermusic20/Projects/ComputerMusic-Project-0Cc-2020-IT.pdf ;

return 0;  //compile time error for sure, xD

## 💡 Concepts & Ideas

### Domain-Specific LLM Concept  
I have designed the concept for a domain-specific Transformer-based LLM, currently in the early stage of exploration.

The idea focuses on:
- a **decoder-centric architecture**,  
- **transfer learning** on a specialized knowledge domain,  
- and a **unique model identity** with a meaningful, original name that reflects its purpose and philosophy.

This is still a conceptual project, but I’m excited by the idea of developing it collaboratively within a team, transforming it from a vision into a real, applied system that solves concrete problems.

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

I'm currently looking for **internships**

I love environments where I can learn fast.
