## Hi, I'm Massimo Belfiore :)

I'm a Computer Science student from Catania with a strong interest in Site Reliability Engineering,
Cloud Engineering, Distributed Systems, and Generative AI.  
I enjoy working on systems that are reliable, scalable and well-designed,  
and I’m motivated by the idea of using technology to improve real-world services,  
especially in healthcare and media platforms.

Backend/Web: PHP/MySQL, Java Servlets, REST APIs, JSON
Cloud & Infra: Linux, Docker, Git, Azure fundamentals
Data & Analytics: MySQL, SQL Server, Pandas, NumPy
Other: Microcontrollers (STM32), basic electronics

Selected Projects
- MySQL Recipe Platform – full relational database design.
- C++ Data Structures – custom implementations of lists, stacks, trees.
- Autogen 0.2 Seminar – technical presentation on LLM agent frameworks.
- Arduino Spectrum Analyzer – audio signal processing with microcontrollers.

Find them all in my pinned repositories.

What I'm Looking For
Internships in Cloud / SRE, Generative AI applications, Backend or API development, Health Informatics.  
I like environments where I can learn fast, automate what can be automated, and contribute to building reliable systems.
