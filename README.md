👤 # Hi, I'm Massimo Belfiore :)
---

I'm a Computer Science student from Catania with a strong interest in Site Reliability Engineering, Cloud Engineering, Distributed Systems, and Generative AI.  
I enjoy working on systems that are reliable, scalable, and well-designed, and I'm motivated by the idea of using technology to improve real-world services -
especially in **Streaming/OTT platforms**, **enterprise**, **healthcare**, **telco**, **automotive**.

I also love working with hardware and low-level systems (and yes… I’m happy even when I deal with Iron (il ferro) 😄).

## 💻 Main Projects

- **MySQL Recipe Platform** — full relational database design plus one web page in php.
- **C++ Data Structures** — custom implementations of lists, stacks, and trees.
- **Autogen 0.2 Seminar** — technical presentation on LLM agent frameworks.  
- **Arduino Spectrum Analyzer** — audio signal processing using microcontrollers.

**You can find some of them in my pinned repositories, and the others at the following links**:

#include <iostream<iostream>>

int main(int argc, char** argv){

char message[] = "I know that goto instruction is dangerous, deprecated and means "Spaghetti Code" but let me use it as it fits good with this";
    
goto cplusplusProject;

std::cout << "Click on the links to see the projects\n";

cplusplusProject:       https://github.com/programmazione2-DMI/a-l-progetto-3-gruppo-2-MassimoBelfioreCode ;

std::cout << message;

goto arduinoAudioProject;

std::cout << "\n";

return 0;  //compile time error for sure, xD

## 💡 Concepts & Ideas

### Domain-Specific LLM Concept  
I have designed the concept for a domain-specific Transformer-based LLM, currently in the early stage of exploration.

The idea focuses on:
- a **decoder-centric architecture**,  
- **transfer learning** on a specialized knowledge domain,  
- and a **unique model identity** with a meaningful, original name that reflects its purpose and philosophy.

This is still a conceptual project, but I’m excited by the idea of developing it collaboratively within a team, transforming it from a vision into a real, applied system that solves concrete problems.

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

I'm currently looking for **internships**

I love environments where I can learn fast and contribute to building reliable, scalable, blinded and meaningful systems with zero downtime.
