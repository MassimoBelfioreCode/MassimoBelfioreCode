Hi, I'm Massimo Belfiore :)

I'm a Computer Science student from Catania with a strong interest in Site Reliability Engineering, Cloud Engineering, Distributed Systems, and Generative AI.
I enjoy working on systems that are reliable, scalable and well-designed, and I’m motivated by the idea of using technology to improve real-world services,
especially in healthcare and media platforms. I'm also happy when I deal with Iron (il ferro).

Skills & Technologies
Languages: Python, C++, Java, PHP, C, C#, SQL

Backend/Web: PHP/MySQL, Java Servlets, REST APIs, JSON, HTML, CSS, HTTP

Cloud & Infra: Linux, Docker, Git, Azure fundamentals

Data & Analytics: MySQL, SQL Server, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scipy

Other: Microcontrollers (STM32), basic electronics

Selected Projects
- MySQL Recipe Platform – full relational database design.
- C++ Data Structures – custom implementations of lists, stacks, trees.
- Autogen 0.2 Seminar – technical presentation on LLM agent frameworks.
- Arduino Spectrum Analyzer – audio signal processing with microcontrollers.

Find them all in my pinned repositories.

Concepts & Ideas
- **Domain-Specific LLM Concept** – I conceived an original idea for a domain-specific LLM based on Transformer architecture. The project is currently in the conceptual phase, focusing on Transfer Learning and specialized applications. The model is designed to bring a unique identity and approach, distinguishing it from existing solutions in the market. The model has a unique and meaningful name that reflects its distinct approach and identity in the LLM landscape.
Excited by the idea of implementing it collaboratively with a team for solving real problems.

What I'm Looking For
Internships in Cloud / SRE, Generative AI applications, Backend or API development.
I like environments where I can learn fast, automate what can be automated, and contribute to building reliable systems.
